## :inbox_tray: Components

* `sddi-base`: Pure CKAN image with image with SDDI styling, groups, topics, and base
  organizations. This is used as base image for the other images.

  ```text
  reg.gitlab.brunowillenborg.de/ckan/sddi-base
  ```

* `sddi-spatial`: `sddi-base` + CKAN spatial extension.

  ```text
  reg.gitlab.brunowillenborg.de/ckan/sddi-spatial
  ```

* `sddi-lite`: `sddi-spatial` + CKAN extension that are required to support SDDI.

  ```text
  reg.gitlab.brunowillenborg.de/ckan/sddi-lite
  ```

* `sddi`: `sddi-lite` + optional CKAN extension for e.g., social media features.

  ```text
  reg.gitlab.brunowillenborg.de/ckan/sddi
  ```

Image tags are the CKAN version. Images are available for CKAN `>=2.9.5`, `>=2.9.5-focal`.
The `latest` tag is (for now) not available.

## :eye_speech_bubble: Requirements

* Due to required dependencies, the `sddi-spatial` image is only available based on
  Debian images (`reg.gitlab.brunowillenborg.de/ckan/sddi-spatial:CKAN_VERSION-focal`).
  Thus, `sddi-lite` and `sddi` are only available as Debian-based images too.

### Extensions used for SDDI

The catalog platform uses several extensions to provide the functionality needed for
the SDDI. Below is a list of all the used extensions.

| Extension | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| [Scheming](https://github.com/MarijaKnezevic/ckanext-scheming) | This extension provides a way to configure and share CKAN schemas using a JSON schema description. Custom template snippets for editing and display are also supported.|
| [GroupHierarchy and Hierarchy](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-hierarchy) | This extension enables tree hierarchyof a organizations and groups.|
| [Datesearch](https://github.com/MarijaKnezevic/ckanext-datesearch) | Provides the ability to search for datasets according to a given time frame. The search includes all datasets, in which the time of validity overlaps in at least one second with the search time frame. |
| [UserAutoAddGroup](https://github.com/tum-gis/ckanext-userautoaddgroup-sddi) | New users are added automatically to the parent groups, which allows them to create datasets linked to these groups. Alls children groups are inherited from the parent groups.|
| [GeoView](https://github.com/pduchesne/ckanext-geoview) | This extension contains view plugins to display geospatial files and services in CKAN.|
| [Composite](https://github.com/EnviDat/ckanext-composite) | The extension allows to store structured dataset metadata, single or multiple fields. Only one level of subfields is possible. The subfields can be basic text, date type o choice dropboxes. |
| [Restricted](https://github.com/MarijaKnezevic/ckanext-restricted) | CKAN extension to restrict the accessibility to the resources of a dataset. This way the package metadata is accesible but not the data itself (resource). The resource access restriction level can be individualy defined for every package.|
| [Spatial](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-spatials) | Provides the ability to search for datasets according to a given spatial extent.|
| [Repeating](https://github.com/MarijaKnezevic/ckanext-repeating) | This extension provides a way to store repeating fields in CKAN datasets, resources, organizations and groups.|
| [Disqus](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-disqus) | The Disqus extension allows site visitors to comment on individual packages using an AJAX-based commenting system. The downsides of this plugin are that comments are not stored locally and user information is not shared between CKAN and the commenting system.|

## :handshake: Thanks

* This repo is based on the CKAN
  [Docker images](https://github.com/keitaroinc/docker-ckan) of
  [Keitaro](https://github.com/keitaroinc). Many thank's for your great work!

## :hammer_and_wrench: Build images

* Switch to the image folder, e.g. `cd sddi-base`
* Run `./build.sh` to the image. Run `./build.sh 2.9.7` to build* using
  a specific CKAN version.
* Use `./build-push.sh` to build and push the image.
