## :inbox_tray: Images overview

- `sddi-base`: CKAN base image with all extensions required for SDDI styling. Default SDDI groups,
  topics, and base organizations are preinstalled. This image is used as base image for the other images.

  ```text
  ghcr.io/tum-gis/ckan-sddi-base
  ```

- `sddi`: `sddi-base` + all required CKAN extensions to support SDDI.

  ```text
  ghcr.io/tum-gis/ckan-sddi
  ```

- `sddi-social`: `sddi` + optional CKAN extension for social media features, that may require staff
  for moderation of social media content.

  ```text
  ghcr.io/tum-gis/ckan-sddi-social
  ```

## :rocket: Usage

The images provided in this repo are designed for the
[`sddi-ckan-k8s`](https://github.com/tum-gis/sddi-ckan-k8s) Helm chart. Go to the Helm chart repository
to find examples an how to run the images.

## :book: Configuration an documentation

The configuration of the Docker images is mainly done using environment variables using the
naming convention of [`ckanext-envvars`](https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-envvars).
Refer to the documentation of [`ckan`](https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/configuration.html)
and the extensions listed below to find the available configuration options.

### Extensions used for SDDI

The catalog platform uses several extensions to provide the functionality needed for the SDDI concept.
The table below lists the extensions with the currently used version. The version refers either to a
*release version*, *commit hash* or *branch name* -> *commit hash*. Versions in the `Dockerfiles` are
alway pinned to a stable release or commit. The branch names are listed here for convenience.

## :handshake: Thanks

* This repo is based on the CKAN
  [Docker images](https://github.com/keitaroinc/docker-ckan) of
  [Keitaro](https://github.com/keitaroinc). Many thank's for your great work!

## :hammer_and_wrench: Build images

* Switch to the image folder, e.g. `cd sddi-base`
* Run `./build.sh` to the image. Run `./build.sh 2.9.7` to build* using
  a specific CKAN version.
* Use `./build-push.sh` to build and push the image.
